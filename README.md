```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

## Within the Password Generator, you will find: 

* Clearly defined notes on the JavaScript functions, variables and different for loops within the generator 
* A working, JavaScript password generator 
* The ability to specify length of password, uppercase, lowercase, symbols and numbers within the password itself 
* The password is then printed onto the screen for user to copy and paste 
* User is able to input different combinations of variables to receive different password variations
* JavaScript is clean, concise and easy to understand
